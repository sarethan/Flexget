I will be adding multiple users to my config in the morning... that way i dont have to share my password with everyone in my family...

i think addding individual useers by way of include files will be easiest... 

plans:
adding a template for family members trakt accounts
adding an include file for all family member tasks (minus those items in the template
add include line to config.yml



it could be possible to add different movies to different plex libraries for better separation of kids movies from the rest of the family.

i guess we will see
